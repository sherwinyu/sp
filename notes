what exactly is the nesting relationship between Acts?
  Act (day)
    Act (hourly -- automatic) -- generated from RescueTime

  four hour segment
    individual activties (Acts)
    and details
  NEED: ability to extract a detail into a new activity



Actual use cases:
  Previously had PLANNED something, now want to track how I'm doing
  Want to see how I'm doing for the day
  Want to see how i'm doing for the hour

Act
  time information
    start_time
    duratio
    end_time
    canonical day (elided by using children acts?)

  is_concrete?
  was_auto_generated?
  details
  auto (raw source of the 
  children
  tags

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------

  1.  Do we distinguish between concrete and abstract actions

  2.  After importing auto data, do we ... modify it? store it?
      thought: should probably have separate collections for auto improted data

  3.  What does a contains_relationship even mean 

  4. Should we explore mongoid trees?

  5. What is the UX for arbitrary data entering gonna look like?
