====
A way to actually rate periods of time as actually high productiviyt or low productivity

Activity Management (rate high, low, manual overrides) and editing
ChromeExtension for full tracking
Weekly Goals
Note Taker

Timeline view


Next steps

  - dashboard showing productivity
  - pusher / pinger in chrome extension
  - refactor datapoints to not suck
  - Sherwinotes
      -- look into protocols!
  - React with ember as data model?

==================================================================

Actual use cases:
  Previously had PLANNED something, now want to track how I'm doing
  Want to see how I'm doing for the day
  Want to see how i'm doing for the hour

Act
  time information
    start_time
    duratio
    end_time
    canonical day (elided by using children acts?)

  is_concrete?
  was_auto_generated?
  details
  auto (raw source of the
  children
  tags

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------

  1.  Do we distinguish between concrete and abstract actions

  2.  After importing auto data, do we ... modify it? store it?
      thought: should probably have separate collections for auto improted data

  3.  What does a contains_relationship even mean

  4.  Should we explore mongoid trees?

  5.  What is the UX for arbitrary data entering gonna look like?


Deatils!
  money:
    spent
    made
    cash
    credit

  exercise

  music
    song
    volume?

  happiness

  focus

  sleepiness

aggregation: addition


sleepiness:aggregation => average

field naming methodology
  sleep
    quality
    hours
    time_spent_before_falling_asleep
    sleepiness
  sleepiness at time spent

Features
  automatic conversion from space to underscore (client side
  button to pull / auto generate hour-long Acts from Rescuetime data
  auto prompting for activities.
  auto suggest tagnames, context, activities when filling in stuff
  Batch renaming on the frontend (of keys), regex replace, regex find

should i have general bucket activities? concrete activities?
concrete and abstract acts?

Plan is made:: Over next 1.5 hrs, will do three things.
  Start recording an act#


Record a plan and act together?

Dashboard should show: active plans



===================================================
DetailsEdit UI
  Asana notes
    no inter-line select (each line is a distinct item)



IDEA:: there will never be invlalid states because implicit string is a catch all
   force all strings to be on oneline!
   if want multiline strings, use explicit strings

   actually, should probably handle this in the tokenizing stage

no invalid states == GOOD, closer to asan ux where you're really just inputting strings and that's it.


key: nested_val

when nclicking nested_val, converts nested vals to a edit field?
